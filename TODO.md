# TODO:

- Allow downscaling input grid -> should add names from outer cols/rows to first cell with different color
- Sort round letters in Preview alfabetically (ex. round 4 when generating for 5 tables)
- Ask for confirmation when overwriting saves
- Add seperate slider to combine rounds in case of # tables < # rounds
